# University Food Search Webapp
Problem Statement:
Based on experiences and feedbacks from many univeristy students, its found that its been very difficult to know the different kind of food outlets available in campus and what food they serve, apparantly making food search troublesome.
Universities have huge campuses and numerous food outlets but a person hardly knows even half of the outlets, where they are located and what food they serve. 
The motivation behind this project is to make sure they have this information is available online which would make food search fun.
The stakeholders would be food service providers like Sodexo, Starbucks, etc.

Objective & System Analysis of the Project:

From the stakeholder point of view they can have a far reach of their food stuff among students which in-turn earn them profits. 
Students can get the food they want and will have many options. Till now there is no solution to address this problem.

Project Details:

Developed project using Ruby and Rails. Used GIT to manage different versions of the application. 
Used Heroku for the deployment purposes.
